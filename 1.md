Hello World
----------
------------

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

<!-- 
Don't put tabs or spaces in front of your paragraphs.

Keep lines left-aligned like this -->

<!-- Line breaks -->
This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.

<!-- Bold -->
I just love **bold text**.<br>
I just love __bold text__.<br>
Love**is**bold.<br>

<!-- Itelic -->
Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.<br>
Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.<br>

<!-- Bold & Itelic -->
This text is ***really important***.<br>
This text is ___really important___.<br>


<!-- Blockquotes -->
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle<br>

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.<br>

<!-- Nested Blockquotes -->
