## 2.Layout Techniqe
- There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:
    - CSS framework
    - CSS float property
    - CSS flexbox
    - CSS grid

 &nbsp;

 ### 1. Float Layout
 - It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility.

### 2.Flex Box Layout
- Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.
